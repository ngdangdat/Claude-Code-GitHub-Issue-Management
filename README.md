# 🤖 Claude Code GitHub Issue Management

An AI-driven development workflow system that automatically manages GitHub Issues.

Inspired by the [Claude Code Agent Communication System](https://github.com/Akira-Papa/Claude-Code-Communication), this system enables AI Workers to automatically resolve GitHub Issues that were previously handled manually through Claude Code.

## Demo

**Features**
1. AI Issue Manager and multiple Workers (default 3, configurable via setup.sh) collaborate to automatically monitor and manage GitHub Issues
2. Automatic Worker assignment when Issues are opened, and automatic PR creation upon resolution
3. Fully automated GitHub Issue → PR → Merge workflow

**System Characteristics:**
- 🔄 Automatic GitHub Issue monitoring and assignment
- 🚀 Parallel development using Git worktree
- 📝 Automatic PR creation and Issue progress comments
- ⚡ Simultaneous multi-Issue processing (up to 3 by default, based on worker count)

# GitHub Issue Management System

## Agent Configuration
- **issue-manager** (multiagent:0.0): GitHub Issue Manager
- **worker1-N** (multiagent:0.1-N): Issue Resolution Workers (N specified in setup.sh, default 3)

## Your Role
- **issue-manager**: @claude/instructions/issue-manager.md
- **worker1-N**: @claude/instructions/worker.md

## Message Sending
```bash
./claude/agent-send.sh [recipient] "[message]"
```

## Basic Flow
GitHub Issues → issue-manager → workers → issue-manager → GitHub PRs
````

> [!WARNING]
> **Please commit and push to main at this point.**
> The main branch must contain these scripts and instructions because issue-manager and workers always start from the latest main.

#### 2️⃣ Environment Setup
```bash
./claude/setup.sh          # Default: 3 workers

# Specify number of workers
./claude/setup.sh 5        # 5 workers

# Specify Claude arguments (show help)
./claude/setup.sh --help

# Example with Claude arguments
ISSUE_MANAGER_ARGS='' WORKER_ARGS='' ./claude/setup.sh                   # Run without Claude arguments
ISSUE_MANAGER_ARGS='--model claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022' \
WORKER_ARGS='--model claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022' ./claude/setup.sh      # Specify a particular model
```
This prepares the specified number of terminal screens in the background!

Claude Code is already running in all panes! Claude authentication in your browser may be required.

#### 3️⃣ Open Issue Manager Screen and Start AI

**Open Issue Manager screen:**
```bash
tmux attach-session -t multiagent
```

A split screen layout appears based on the specified number of workers (default: issue-manager + 3 workers):
```
┌─────────────┬─────────────┐
│issue-manager│   worker1   │
├─────────────┼─────────────┤
│   worker2   │   worker3   │
└─────────────┴─────────────┘
```

#### 4️⃣ Start GitHub Issue Management

Input in the Issue Manager screen (by default targets issues with assignee:@me):
```
You are the issue-manager. Please start monitoring GitHub Issues according to the instructions.
```

To filter target issues:
```
You are the issue-manager. Please start monitoring GitHub Issues according to the instructions. Target issues should be unassigned and have the bug label.
```

**This automatically:**
1. Issue Manager monitors GitHub Issues
2. When new Issues are created, they are assigned to Workers
3. Workers resolve Issues and create PRs
4. Issue Manager performs confirmation and quality management

#### 🗑️ Uninstallation
```bash
# Remove GitHub Issue Management System
rm -rf ./claude
```

# GitHub Issue Management System

## Agent Configuration
- issue-manager: GitHub Issue Manager
- worker1,2,3: Issue Resolution Workers

## Basic Flow
GitHub Issues → issue-manager → workers → GitHub PRs
```

## 🎯 GitHub Issue Management Workflow

### Typical Flow
1. **Issue Creation**: Developer creates Issue on GitHub
2. **Automatic Monitoring**: Issue Manager periodically monitors Issue list
3. **Worker Assignment**: Assign Issue to available Worker
4. **Environment Preparation**: Automatically instruct Worker to set up environment
5. **Issue Resolution**: Worker analyzes Issue content and implements solution
6. **PR Creation**: Worker automatically creates Pull Request upon completion
7. **Quality Check**: Issue Manager reviews PR and Issue
8. **Completion Process**: After merge, assign next Issue

### Supported Features
- ✅ **Parallel Processing**: Handle up to 3 Issues simultaneously
- ✅ **Git worktree**: Independent work environment per branch
- ✅ **Automatic Comments**: Automatic recording of Issue progress
- ✅ **Quality Management**: Local verification and test execution

## 🌿 Git Worktree Management System

### Purpose of Worktree
The GitHub Issue Management System creates Git worktrees for each Issue, enabling parallel development.

### 🛡️ Enhanced Worker Security Environment
Important security measures implemented in Issue #6:

#### Worker Environment Isolation
- **Claude Launch Control**: setup.sh only starts Claude for issue-manager, workers remain in standby
- **Automatic worktree Migration**: Automatically move worker to worktree directory upon Issue assignment
- **Process Detection**: Accurately determine Claude execution state using `pane_current_command`
- **Safe Exit**: Prevent shell termination through Claude safe exit via agent-send.sh

#### Operation Flow
```bash
# Initial state (after setup.sh execution)
issue-manager: Claude started (root directory)
worker1-N: Standby message displayed (Claude not started)

# During Issue assignment
1. Create/verify worktree
2. Check worker process state (zsh/node)
   - zsh → Start Claude directly
   - node → Exit via agent-send.sh → Restart Claude
3. Move to worktree directory
4. Restart Claude

# Upon Issue completion
1. Check worker process state
2. Safe Claude exit (if running)
3. Return to root directory
4. Return to standby state
```

#### Security Benefits
- **Main Branch Protection**: Prevent workers from accidentally working in root directory
- **Complete Environment Isolation**: Each Issue runs in independent worktree environment
- **Automatic Recovery**: Workers automatically return to clean state upon Issue completion

### Worktree Directory Structure
```
project-root/
├── .git/
├── main-code-files...
├── worktree/               # Dedicated Worktree Directory
│   ├── issue-123/         # Work environment for Issue #123
│   ├── issue-456/         # Work environment for Issue #456
│   └── issue-789/         # Work environment for Issue #789
└── .gitignore             # worktree/ automatically added
```

> [!NOTE]
> `setup.sh` adds `worktree/` to `.gitignore`.

### Worktree Lifecycle

1. **Creation**:
   - Check existing worktree directory (`-d "worktree/issue-XXX"`)
   - If exists: cd to existing worktree and continue
   - If not exists: `git worktree add worktree/issue-XXX -b issue-XXX`
2. **Development**: Issue resolution work in isolated environment
3. **Verification**: Quality check by Issue Manager
4. **Deletion**: `git worktree remove worktree/issue-XXX --force`

### Security and Benefits

#### Claude Code Security Compliance
- **Subdirectory Restriction**: `worktree/` is safe as a subdirectory
- **Path Restriction Avoidance**: Design that doesn't use `../` paths

#### Development Efficiency Improvement
- **Parallel Development**: Handle up to 3 Issues simultaneously
- **Environment Isolation**: Completely independent environment for each Issue
- **Dependency Isolation**: No conflicts even with different package versions
- **Branch Management**: Automatic `issue-XXX` branch creation

#### Automatic Management
- **Automatic `.gitignore` Update**: Automatic addition of `worktree/` entry
- **Directory Creation**: Automatic creation during setup
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Automatic deletion upon Issue completion



### Troubleshooting

#### When Worktree Remains
```bash
# Manual cleanup
git worktree list
git worktree remove worktree/issue-XXX --force
rm -rf worktree/issue-XXX
```



## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Q: Agents not responding
```bash
# Check status
tmux ls

# Restart
./setup.sh
```

### Q: Messages not being delivered
```bash
# Check logs
cat logs/send_log.txt

# Manual test
./agent-send.sh issue-manager "test"
./agent-send.sh worker1 "test"
```

### Q: Want to start from scratch
```bash
# Reset everything
tmux kill-server
rm -rf ./tmp/*
./setup.sh
```

## 🚀 Create and Test GitHub Issues

### Simple Example: GitHub Issue Creation and Workflow

1. **Create Issue on GitHub**:
```
Title: Add TODO list feature
Description:
- Add/edit/delete TODO items
- Mark items as complete
- Save to localStorage
```

2. **Issue Manager operates automatically**:
```bash
# Confirm with Issue Manager
./agent-send.sh issue-manager "Please start monitoring GitHub Issues"
```

3. **Automatically executed flow**:
   - Issue Manager detects new Issue
   - Assign to available Worker
   - Worker resolves Issue and creates PR
   - Issue Manager confirms PR

## 📊 How the System Works (Illustrated)

### Screen Layout
```
┌─────────────┬─────────────┐
│issue-manager│   worker1   │ ← Issue Manager (green) and Worker1 (blue)
├─────────────┼─────────────┤
│   worker2   │   worker3   │ ← Worker2 and 3 (blue)
└─────────────┴─────────────┘
```

### GitHub Issue Management Flow
```
GitHub Issues
 ↓ "Issue #123 created"
Issue Manager
 ↓ "Assigned to Worker1"
Worker1
